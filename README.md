# Obama and Romney 2012 Speeches
Obama & Romney's 2012 Campaign and Fundraiser Speeches digitized.
This data was collected from http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu (Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project.)
The data is organized as follow:
1. type: Whether the event was a Campaign Rally or Fundraiser
2. date: The date of the event (mm/dd/yyyy)
3. city: The city where the event took place
4. state: The state where the event took place
5. notes: e.g., if this was the second, third or fourth event at that location in that day. Or if there was a 'q and a' session at that event.
6. speech: Text of the speech given that that event. 

Please note that the Presidency Project did not have speeches from fundraisers for Mitt Romney. Additionally, some Romney speeches have been edited to exclude content from other speakers, such as when another speaker gave extended opening remarks.

If you have any questions or require any additional information please let me know. Also, feedback on any typos, mistakes or other errors will be greatly appreciated.
